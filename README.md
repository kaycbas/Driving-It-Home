# Driving-It-Home
A simulation with graphics of a city with self-driving cars and randomly generated destinations. Sensory and decision controllers are used by the cars to make real time decisions to reach their destinations safely.

## The Self-Driving Car Platform

The self driving car platform is implemented in the AIController class, which implements the IControl Interface and makes use of three different subsystems:
1. Sensing
2. Perception
3. Planning and Reacting

Each of these subsystems handles a third of the task of controlling the car autonomously. Firstly, the Sensing subsystem processes the world around the car, creating three different maps:
• A velocity change map • A space map
• A colour map

These three outputs show the state of the world around the car in terms that can be processed and analysed. Secondly, the Perception subsystem analyses the three different maps to recognize objects of interest in the nearby surroundings. It is responsible for combining the three maps to identify objects based on known profiles and converting this information into PerceptionResult objects to be given to the final subsystem, the Planning subsystem.
The Planning subsystem takes the PerceptionResult objects generated by the Perception subsystem and, using this information, makes decisions about what action the car needs to take, if anything. The Planning subsystem makes direct calls back to the AIController to manipulate the car, accelerating, decelerating and turning.
